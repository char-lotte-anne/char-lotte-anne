# 👋 Hi, I’m Charlotte Larson Freeman

I'm a CS undergrad at Western Washington University, graduating in March 2026. My interests live at the intersection of **AI ethics**, **systems programming**, and **human-centered design** — especially where software can improve fairness, accessibility, and user experience.

---

## 👩‍🔬 What I’m Passionate About
- Building software that’s not just functional, but **ethical and inclusive**
- Exploring **bias and accessibility in AI**
- Developing **interactive tools** that make complex topics (like quaternion math or social media literacy) more engaging and understandable
- Applying **low-level systems knowledge** to practical, impactful software projects

---

## 🔬 Technical Highlights
- **R&D Intern at Silfab Solar:** Built image analysis tools for solar cell alignment using custom centroid detection algorithms and OpenCV-based visualization
- **AI Ethics Researcher:** Co-developed a coding schema to evaluate ableist language in LLMs; designed prompts and analyzed output for fairness and accessibility
- **Educational Projects:** Designed and implemented simulations and prototypes related to compiler construction, 3D transformations, and social impact education
- **STEM Outreach Leader:** Taught coding to over 100 K–8 students; led summer camp programming and curriculum development

## 🗂️ GitHub Projects — Coming Soon

Due to academic integrity and confidentiality policies, many of my past projects can't be shared publicly. I'm currently in the process of rebuilding and documenting new projects here on GitHub, including:

- A **quaternion rotation demo** with interactive scenes
- A **simulated stock trading strategy**
- Visual tools and analysis code similar to my **solar image processing work**

🦾 In the meantime, feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarsonfreeman/) or contact me directly to discuss the technical details of my work.
